# sql-injection-prevention-detection
Developed a machine learning-based system to detect and prevent SQL Injection attacks using a Random Forest Classifier. The project involved collecting and analyzing SQL queries, extracting relevant features, and training a classification model to distinguish between benign and malicious queries.

Key Features:
âœ” Machine Learning-Based Detection â€“ Utilized Random Forest for accurate classification of SQL injection attempts.
âœ” Web Application Interface â€“ Built a Django-based backend with an HTML & CSS frontend for real-time query validation.
âœ” Security Enhancement â€“ Designed to protect databases from unauthorized access, data breaches, and privilege escalation.

Technologies Used:
ðŸ”¹ Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas)
ðŸ”¹ Django (Backend Development)
ðŸ”¹ HTML, CSS (Frontend)
ðŸ”¹ SQL (Database Management)

Impact:
ðŸ”¹ Strengthened web application security by detecting SQL Injection attacks in real time.
ðŸ”¹ Reduced false positives by leveraging machine learning over traditional rule-based detection.
ðŸ”¹ Provided a scalable solution for organizations to secure their databases against cyber threats.
